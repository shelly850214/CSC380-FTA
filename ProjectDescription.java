	/*
	 * Food often goes to waste in our fridges, and this app is designed
	 * to help mitigate that occurrence. In addition to being a searchable log that keeps
	 * track of what is in the fridge, pantry, and freezer at any given time, this app
	 * will also provide reminders to the user when food is close to expiring. Another
	 * feature is to be able to check if a recipe has the ingredients available on hand,
	 * or if it should be added to a grocery list, which the app will also generate for
	 * the user at regular intervals, comprised of all the food that went bad or was used
	 * since the last generation, and can have items added manually. Users can also
	 * categorize the foods with tags they decide and search by category. This app will
	 * use persistent memory so as to be useful after closing the program. Any food can be
	 * removed or added, and any feature has the ability to add or remove foods. Favorite
	 * recipes can be stored and categorized as well. Lastly, a basic GUI will be implemented
	 * to make navigation easier, though it will also be command line usable as well.
	 *
